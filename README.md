# Genkgo DTK

This Design Toolkit is a fork of the Broccoli project. The Broccoli project as is does not match the
asset pipeline that is used by Genkgo. There is no HTTP server required and `broccoli serve`
does not allow the resulting tree to be outputted in a different location than `/tmp`. This project
focuses on matching Genkgo's front-end requirements while keep contributing to the Broccoli project.
